live site:https://korede1004.github.io/Huddle/

After 6 weeks of intensive training with TECHACHON 1.0
This is my second personal project in TECHATHON 1.0 "HUDDLE" 

I built a website "Huddle landing page with a single introductory section" with just html and css, responsive for 375px and 1440px screen size with active states.
During the cause of this project I learnt how to center an icon in a rounded border and how to increase font awesome icon
